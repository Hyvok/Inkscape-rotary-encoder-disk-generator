## About the Project
Inkscape rotary encoder disk generator is an extension for Inkscape (http://inkscape.org/) which enables you to
conveniently create optical encoder discs. It currently supports creating single and two-track (quadrature)
encoders, gray encoders, single-track gray encoders (at least for cases mentioned in NZ patent 264738)
and bitmap encoders.
